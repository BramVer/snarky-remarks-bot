# snarky-slack-bot
Quick Slack bot implementation to choose a random response from a list upon a given trigger message.

## What is this
This is a quick implementation of a Slack Bot that looks for a pattern in a message.  
When it finds an occurence, it will comment a random response taken from a predefined text file and start a/comment on the thread.

## Why
Why not? ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”

## Setup
1. Provide a list of responses (separated by new-lines) in a text file somewhere the bot has access.

    `echo "Yawn.... Oh, were you speaking?" >> ~/.config/snarky_responses.txt`

2. Create a `.env` file with the proper configuration values

    cp .env.default snark_bot/.env
    vim snark_bot/.env

3. Call the module from Python

    python -m snark_bot
